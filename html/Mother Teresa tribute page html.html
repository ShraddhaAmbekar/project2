                <p>
                    <b>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu MC</b> (born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, Albanian: 26
                    August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother Teresa, was an Albanian-Indian Catholic
                    nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. Born in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman
                    Empire, at the age of 18 she moved to Ireland and later to India, where she lived most of her
                    life. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised by the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. The
                    anniversary of her death, 5 September, is her feast day.
                </p><br>

                <p>Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over
                    4,500 nuns across 133 countries as of 2012.The congregation manages homes for people who are
                    dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens,
                    dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages
                    and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to
                    give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."</p><br>

                <p> Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979
                    Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was
                    admired by many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and
                    contraception, as well as the poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography,
                    written by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992, and she has been the subject of many other works. On
                    6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic
                    Archdiocese of Calcutta.
